# Image Processing Application

A powerful image processing application built with Chef using Convex as its backend.

## Overview


## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Located in the `app` directory and built with Vite
- **Backend**: Located in the `convex` directory
- **Development**: Run `npm run dev` to start both frontend and backend servers simultaneously

## Features

- Advanced image processing capabilities
- Real-time updates through Convex backend
- Responsive user interface

## Authentication

This application uses Convex Auth with Anonymous authentication for easy sign-in. Consider updating the authentication method before deploying to production for enhanced security.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended version: 16+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Processing-Application.git
   cd Image-Processing-Application
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start development servers:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The application should now be running on `localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite)

## HTTP API

User-defined HTTP routes are defined in the `convex/router.ts` file. These routes are separated from `convex/http.ts` to prevent the LLM from modifying the authentication routes.
